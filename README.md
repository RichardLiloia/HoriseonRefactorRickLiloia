ReadMe: Horiseon is the marketing agency that has hired 
me, and it has done so to refactor their site's code. This
on-the-job ticket involves pre-existing starter-code 
that I modified in order to implement sufficient 
accessibility.  They ordered this refactoring done for
various reasons.  By editing the code to make it more 
accessible, it will help the company avoid any possible
litigation, while at the same time it will help their 
business gain exposure by being better positioned in 
search engines like Google.  Horiseon even notes in their
user story that this optimization for search engines is 
their site's current ultimate goal.
